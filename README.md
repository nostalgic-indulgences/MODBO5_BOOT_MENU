This collection of system files for the MODBO 5 is used for my personal testing only and I cannot guarantee that it will work in every setup due to the shear number of permutations of various mods and console versions available for the PS2.

The OPL Version is sourced from 8BitMods branch of the code that targets the Retro GEM GameID for my personal testing.

Due to the numerous branches of OPL out there, compatibility would require further testing as well.
As the memory allocation to the initial boot menu of MODBO 5 seems very limited, I would suspect that huge libraries or even cover arts could be a potential issue. 
This would need a lot more time for verification and testing once again.
